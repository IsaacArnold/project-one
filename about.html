        <h2>My journey so far...</h2>
        <p>After graduating from high school in 2012, I began my journey into the real world. Between the years of 2013-2015, I studied a Bachelor of Business majoring in Event and Sport Management at Griffith University. This degree gave me some amazing insight into the events and sporting world, along with a sound knowledge of general business concepts which I still use today. </p>
        <p>Having completed my university degree, I set off on an overseas adventure - working at Walt Disney World in Florida, USA! Here I lived and worked as a part of the Disney College Program as a lifeguard at the Yacht & Beach resort. I made friends from all over the globe and loved the six months I spent in sunny Florida! It was here at Disney that I met my New Zealand-born girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Returning to Brisbane in 2016, my girlfriend moved countries and lived in Australia with me until 2017. After spending plenty of time in the Brisbane heat, we decided it was time for somewhere cooler. We packed up and moved to Tauranga, New Zealand. Here my girlfriend studied to become a teacher and I worked in digital marketing. We love New Zealand and everything it has to offer! </p>
        <h3>A little more about me...</h3>
        <p>In my free time, you'll find me being very active. From riding my bike to playing disc golf I love being outside and building up a sweat. To relax I like to read, drink plenty of coffee and playing my PS4. I've always loved technology and am extremely excited to pursue my new-found interest in coding and web development.</p>
